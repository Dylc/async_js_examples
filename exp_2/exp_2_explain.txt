In  iteration we start promise and and then in this promise
The iteration doesn't wait that promise will be settled
That' why we see 
Starting for 1
Starting for 2
Starting for 3
Starting for 4
Starting for 5

After the iteration is done, we go the next line, till the "task" isn't done
After we exit from iteration and print Done, 

in this place the task is done, and we can resolve our promises

and after we start to settle out promises
all of them are strated approximately in the same time, so we will see
2,4 - in parallel (where 2 is expected to be the first)
1,5 - in parallel (where 1 is expected to be the first)
3 - the last
